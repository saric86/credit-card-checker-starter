Credit card checker is a javascript function that checks if credit cards are valid or invalid. 
There are multiple functions:
One is checking for invalid credit card nr, and sorting valid and invalid nr.
One function returns a list of companies connected to invalid credit card numbers. e.g if credit card starts with "3" and is invalid, then the function will return "American Express"
